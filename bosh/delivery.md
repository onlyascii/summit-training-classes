# Delivering The Course

## Material Philosophy

This course is designed to educate students via hands-on experience.

## Structure

The course should last no more than a single day, and a typical delivery looks thus:

* Introductions
* For each module:
  * Slides
  * Lab
  * Recap
* Retrospective

### Introductions

You may want to ask individuals to introduce themselves, what they want to get out of the day (so you can help them more effectively) and maybe some sort of icebreaker question.

Additionally students should be shown to the course site, and provided any credentials necessary.

### Slides

Slides exist to introduce concepts and explain background information. **Slides should _not_ feature excessive implementation detail**, as this will not be remembered by students and will also become out of date very quickly.

The slides are intentionally light on diagrams, knowing that these will instead be produced ad-hoc by the instructor in recaps.

### Labs

**Labs give students hands-on experience**. Students are encouraged to use the official documentation and self-documenting tools (like the CF CLI) which will always be accurate and contemporary. Additionally this teaches the students to become self-sufficient.

**Labs should not include answers**. Students should not be able to complete exercises only by copy/pasting.

Labs should **make it clear** to students **when they have done the right thing**.

Students should be encouraged to help each other; humans learn better in social environments.

The **labs do not build upon one another**, hence if labs have to be abandoned due to time constraints this will not impact later exercises.

### Recaps

Interactive recap sessions should be held after each module where appropriate. The instructor should **gather the students around a whiteboard** and ask them a series of questions about the lab exercises they just completed. For example:

* What did you just do?
* What does the CLI talk to?
* How does the CLI remember who you are?

As each question is answered, the instructor draws relevant components of Cloud Foundry on the whiteboard. Be careful to not fall into the trap of explaining without first asking questions: people are more likely to remember information if they were asked about it previously - even if when asked they had no chance of knowing the answer!

The recap sessions further cement knowledge in the students, allow the instructor to delve into details upon request, and also allow the instructor to gauge how much of the prior material has been understood.

It is okay to repeat elements between recaps, as this reinforces learning. For example, you will likely find yourself drawing the `cf push` flow several time. If the class grow weary of answering the same questions in each recaps, you can turn this into a game of the class calling out what happens more quickly than you can draw the diagram.

### Retrospective

An **agile retrospective should be held at the end of the day**, to highlight areas of improvement for the instructor(s) and the course, and allow students vent any frustrations they may have had.
