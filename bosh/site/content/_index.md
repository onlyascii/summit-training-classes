Join us for a **hands-on** training workshop to learn about **deploying and managing services on BOSH**. We will give an overview of BOSH and how it works, including specifics relating to jobs, packages, blobs, deployments and day to day operations. We will also look at how to effectively work with BOSH in your organization.

This training is targeted at people with **little or no BOSH experience** but some experience using the console. If you're curious to learn how BOSH can help you focus on **development and innovation**, rather than infrastructure plumbing, this is the right course for you.
