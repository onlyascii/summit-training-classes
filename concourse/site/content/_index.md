Join us for a **hands-on** training workshop to learn about **using Concourse CI**. We will give an overview of Concourse CI and how it works, including specifics relating to jobs, tasks and day to day operations. We will also look at how to effectively work with Concourse CI in your organization.

This training is targeted at people with **little or no Concourse CI experience** but some experience using the console. If you're curious to learn how Concourse CI can help you focus on **development and innovation**, rather than infrastructure plumbing, this is the right course for you.
